# HAND-GESTURE-RECOGNITION
Developed a computer vision project using Python, OpenCV, and deep learning to recognize and classify hand gestures in real-time captured through a webcam.  Collected the Data using OpenCV Python code and integrated a pre-trained deep learning model for image classification to accurately recognize and classify hand gestures in the captured images.
